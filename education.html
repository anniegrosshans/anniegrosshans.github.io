      <p>Some of us at SixBucks Brew actually remember <a class="first-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks#Founding">the first Starbucks</a> And although credit must be given where credit's due - that Starbucks was afterall the original Mothership, we now enjoy her bean grown grandchildren that you're finding your way to with us.</p>

      <p> From those Pike Place origins grew the Seattle culture of the love of good coffee, sourced from coffee fields around the world, well roasted and available today in our many local brand roasteries and thought filled coffe houses.

  <p> By the mid 1980's things really took off in the cafine city when more and more small business Tom, Dick and Harrys realized that the profit margin on a single cup was, well, substantial. And besides, a day spent pulling espressos for fellow citizens, providing a spot to pause and be, was a fine way to spend the day.</p>

  <h2>So what's with this <span>Thought Filled</span> association wtih coffee and coffee drinking?</h2>
  <p> Like other human joys, coffee is a pleasurable social and physical stimulant.</p>

  <h3>Medieval Coffee Shops Go West</h3>
<p>In 1453, coffee drinking was introduced to Constantinople (modern Istanbul) by the Ottomans. The world's first coffee shop, Kiva Han, opened in Constantinople in 1475.</p>

<p>Maybe those who enjoy sipping and talking and reading in their favorite coffee spots today are allowing themselves a little piece of those long ago days pace of life. </p>
